GlitchBooth Demo for the pcDuino3 and CSI Camera Module

Featured on Sparkfun.com 10/24/14 New Product Friday

Based on the jpglitch project found at https://github.com/Kareeeeem/jpglitch 
(included here in full)

Description: This project uses the pcDuino3 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12856) and 2MP Camera Module (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13100) to capture a photo and artistically corrupt it. A button press on D2 will capture an image, save it to the disk and display it using Feh (http://feh.finalrewind.org/). A button press on D3 will process the last image captured using the jpglitch method, save the output to the disk and display it using Feh. 

Simply connect the camera module to your pcDuino3 and run the Python script! 

Enjoy!
